Wow what the hell is going on in here even?

Ok so, several templates use this big header with a giant BG image. Nice idea, but big images
have a heavy impact on performance, so it's a good idea to make them responsive. Because we
can only get the image dynamically using Handlebars, and we can only set the image to properly
be a background image using CSS, we end up with a handful of inline styles.

If the template in question has a background image, then we render responsive image styles
for it, and apply those styles to the <header> tag. Else, we just output a <header> tag
with a `no-image` class so we can style it accordingly.

{{#if feature_image}}

<style type="text/css">
    .responsive-{{slug}}-img {
        background-image: url({{img_url feature_image size='m'}});
    }

    @media(max-width: 767px) {
        .responsive-{{slug}}-img {
            background-image: url({{img_url feature_image size='m'}});
        }
    }
</style>
<div class="h-40 md:h-64 responsive-{{slug}}-img bg-cover bg-center">

{{else}}

<div class="h-40 md:h-64 bg-black">
